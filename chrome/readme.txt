I found myself frustrated many times on sharing my favorites desktop browser's link for on-the-go reading on mobile phone. Sending myself the link via is OK, but too complicate. Chrome-to-Android extension is awesome, but limited only for Android devices. QR Code is universal and flexible for other camera-equipped devices, featured and smart-phones.
